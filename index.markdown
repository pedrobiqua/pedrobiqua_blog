# Welcome to My Blog

Hello, I'm Pedro! I'm a Computer Science student with a passion for technology, innovation, and data analysis.

Curiosity always drives me to explore new paths in programming, alongside machine learning and web development. I enjoy conducting research and using my communication skills and effort to develop unique projects, always striving to offer a fresh perspective.

I have applied my skills in loan systems to also develop a system for generating truly random numbers in research. Additionally, I've used my knowledge of Python to analyze the dissimilarity space in the context of concept drift to build a classifier based on scikit-learn.

I'm always open to new connections and excited about new challenges and opportunities to apply my passion for computer science. If you share my enthusiasm for data analysis or programming, Iâ€™m ready to collaborate.
