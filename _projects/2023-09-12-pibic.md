This project explores the development of a **True Quantum Random Number Generator**, leveraging the inherent randomness of radioactive decay to produce truly random numbers. Unlike pseudo-random number generators, which depend on deterministic algorithms, this approach relies on quantum phenomena to achieve genuine unpredictability.

The research includes analyzing the statistical properties of the generated numbers using tests like Chi-square and Kolmogorov-Smirnov, ensuring the output meets the highest standards of randomness. Applications of this generator span cryptography, secure communications, and high-precision simulations, where the quality of randomness is critical.

By combining principles of quantum mechanics with advanced computational techniques, this project aims to contribute to the advancement of secure and reliable systems in various domains.
