Hi, I'm Pedro! I graduated in Computer Science from PUC-PR and am deeply passionate about artificial intelligence. I'm currently a member of the AI League and preparing to start my master's degree in AI. I'm also working on a personal project to create a search engine library that integrates AI to deliver smarter and more efficient search solutions.
